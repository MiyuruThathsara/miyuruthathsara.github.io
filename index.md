## Publications
- **FPGA Stereo Visual SLAM with Efficient Stereo Feature Matching and Key-frame Generation** *(FPL&nbsp;2025) (First Author)*
  *Abstract:* Stereo visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) enables autonomous agents to navigate complex environments by simultaneously building metric maps and localizing within them. In this paper, we present the first FPGA-based System-on-Chip (SoC) implementation of stereo visual SLAM. Our design reduces stereo feature matching latency by dynamically grouping descriptors based on localized image regions and descriptor similarity, while preserving matching accuracy. We also revisit conventional key-frame generation strategies and show that some criteria lead to unnecessary map expansion and runtime instability on resource-constrained platforms. To address this, we propose a new key-frame generation method based on the tracking status of local map points in the current frame. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks show that our system achieves high robustness and real-time performance with notable performance-power gains, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art stereo SLAM methods on embedded platforms. Real-world experiments further confirm our system’s suitability for practical robotic applications. *[Accepted]*
- **Hardware-Efficient Homogenized Key-Point Selection for Visual SLAM** *(FPT&nbsp;2024) (First Author)*
  *Abstract:* Homogenized key-point selection is key to achieving robust visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in autonomous agents. We present the first FPGA-based visual SLAM accelerator capable of selecting uniformly distributed key-points from video frames in real-time. Using a novel gridbased streaming hardware architecture and an efficient neighbor sorting algorithm for dynamic input sizes, our design enhances robustness and resource efficiency compared to existing methods, while meeting real-time requirements. Evaluations using challenging datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art systems. [Search](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11113393)
- **Hardware Accelerator for Feature Matching with Binary Search Tree** *(ISCAS&nbsp;2024) (First Author)*  
  *Abstract:* Feature matching is an essential step for autonomous robot to localize itself during navigation. However, it is often difficult to achieve the matching in real-time due to limited on-board computing resources. We present an FPGA implementation for stream-processing based feature matching called Binary Search Tree Matcher (BSTM) that utilizes a balanced binary search tree. To improve the matching precision, we integrated a ratio-test (RT) outlier rejection mechanism in our design. Our proposed FPGA-based BSTM is scalable and resource efficient, and significantly faster than the best-performing hardware implementation in the literature. When compared to the commonly used Linear Exhaustive Search (LES) method running on the FPGA, our proposed design is approximately 12X faster. [Search](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10558431)
- **Dynamically Growing Neural Network Architecture for Lifelong Deep Learning on the Edge** *(FPL&nbsp;2020) (Co-Author 2nd)*  
  *Abstract:* Conventional deep learning models are trained once and deployed. However, models deployed in agents operating in dynamic environments need to constantly acquire new knowledge, while preventing catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. This ability is commonly referred to as lifelong learning. In this paper, we address the performance and resource challenges for realizing lifelong learning on edge devices. We propose a FPGA based architecture for a Self-Organization Neural Network (SONN), that in combination with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can perform class-incremental lifelong learning for object classification. The proposed SONN architecture is capable of performing unsupervised learning on input features from the CNN by dynamically growing neurons and connections. In order to meet the tight constraints of edge computing, we introduce efficient scheduling methods to maximize resource reuse and parallelism, as well as approximate computing strategies. Experiments based on the Core50 dataset for continuous object recognition from video sequences demonstrated that the proposed FPGA architecture significantly outperforms CPU and GPU based implementations.

- **Feasibility Study of a Novel Cross Assembled Multi‑quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle** *(ICIAfS&nbsp;2018) (Acknowledged)*  
  *Abstract:* In this paper, a feasibility study for construction and control of a novel design of a Multi-quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented. This novel concept tests four identical Quadrotors assembled in a bigger cross structure. And, it also tests the ability of using the same controller that is used to control a single quadrotor to fly the novel design of cross assembled four quadrotor UAV. The main objective here is to improve redundancy and robustness and load carrying capacity of quadrotor UAVs. Even though there are four quadrotors, there is only one controller involves. When each individual Quadrotor works on a certain flight maneuver, it is expected that the assembled UAV of four of these in a cross structure to also be able to demonstrate the same maneuver. The prototype of the novel UAV was designed and built, and has been experimentally tested for a proof of concept where it was able to stabilize the new UAV with the same controller that is used in typical quadrotors with minimal modifications. New UAV will provide the user with the ability to lift more weight while also allowing plug-and-play replacement of individual Quadrotors in the assembly.
